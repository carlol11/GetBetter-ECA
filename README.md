# Embodied Conversational Agent System for Public Health Monitoring of Filipino Children

The Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) System is an Android application developed for tablets. The app will allow you to interact with an ECA named GeeBee for health monitoring and consultation purposes. GeeBee is your personal healthcare assistant! Throughout your use of the app, she will guide you through routine tests, ask questions about your health, and give advice to help you stay healthy. GeeBee is part of the GetBetter Telemedicine System which aims to connect Filipino patients with doctors and patients.

The application is designed for use by children aged 6 to 14 years old. The use of the app also requires the help of an older child or adult who will act as an assistant to help in monitoring and consultation activities. GeeBee is designed to allow for assistants who do not need prior medical knowledge or training.
